# Simple testing of React with SocketIO and React-Vis

![StonkShot](screenshot.png?raw=true "Stonks Screenshot")

POC Mostly.. very badly implemented, RNG Based. No data makes sense asides from Time

The CSS is terrible.

It crashes a lot, lots of errors.. but the idea is there.. 8^)

There are a lot more "features" I may or may not add. I may even fix things? Who knows? :dolladollabillyall:

NOTE: yarn start defaults to HOST=0.0.0.0 for mobile testing
Change package.json if not wanted

Client runs on :3000
Server runs on :4001

## Start Express SockerIO Server

```bash
    cd server
    nodemon app
```

## Start Client

```bash
    yarn start
```
